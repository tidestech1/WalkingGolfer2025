## type_safety
- Use TypeScript's type system fully — no `any` types
- All data must match types from `src/types/*.ts`
- Field names must be verified against schema before use
- Use `null` for optional fields, never empty strings
- Run type checks and fix all errors before committing

## firebase_usage
- Always access Firebase through `useFirebase` or `firebaseUtils.ts`
- Never access Firebase objects (`db`, `auth`, etc.) directly in components
- Wrap all Firebase operations in try/catch
- Provide fallback data when Firebase is unavailable
- Use Replit Secrets — never commit `.env` files

## collections
- Only use the following Firestore collections:
  - `courses`
  - `reviews`
  - `users`
  - `news`
  - `contacts`
  - `newsletters`
  - `courseRatingUpdates`

## geographic_scope
- App scope is USA-only
- All golf courses must be within US coordinates
- `state` field must use valid US state codes (e.g. CA, TX, FL) DC is an acceptable exception

## ui_guidelines
- Use color, spacing, and typography tokens from `src/docs/brandguide.md`
- Use Tailwind and ShadCN/UI for all UI components

## deployment_env
- Secrets are stored in Replit Secrets Manager
- Deployment is through Replit (do not use `.env` files)
- Cursor connects via SSH to Replit

## klaviyo_integration
- For ALL Klaviyo integration work, you MUST first read and follow the guide at `docs/klaviyo-integration-guide.md`
- Use API version `2023-12-15` and the implementation in `src/lib/klaviyo.ts`
- Never use the old server-side functions implementation
- Test against newsletter signup as working baseline before making changes

## agent_guidelines
- Before performing significant file modifications or implementing new features, you MUST read and understand the project overview located at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
