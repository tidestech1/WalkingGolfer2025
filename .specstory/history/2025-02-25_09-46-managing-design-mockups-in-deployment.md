## Managing Design Mockups in Deployment (25/02/2025, 09:46:55)

_**User**_

We dont need to make the design mockups live so if we add this to the .gitingnore file will it make sure they are not deployed when we ask replit to update the live site?

# Ignore design mockups
public/design/

_**Assistant**_

Yes, adding `public/design/` to your `.gitignore` file will prevent any files in that directory from being included in git commits and therefore won't be deployed when Replit updates the live site.

Looking at your current `.gitignore` file:


```1:39:/.gitignore
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js
.yarn/install-state.gz

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
/.next/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env*.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts

.env

```


Let's add the design mockups directory. I'll add it in the "misc" section:

```gitignore:/.gitignore
# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js
.yarn/install-state.gz

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
/.next/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem
public/design/

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env*.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts

.env
```

This will ensure that:
1. Any files in the `public/design/` directory are ignored by git
2. The design mockups won't be included in deployments
3. You can still keep the mockups locally for reference
4. The rest of your public assets will still be included in deployments

something seems stuck in your processing?

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the stuck processing in my previous response. Let me provide a clearer, more concise answer:

Yes, adding `public/design/` to your `.gitignore` file will prevent the design mockups from being deployed. Here's the simple edit needed:

```gitignore:/.gitignore
// ... existing code ...
# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem
public/design/
// ... existing code ...
```

This will ensure the design mockups stay local and aren't included in your Replit deployments while keeping all other necessary files in your deployment process.
