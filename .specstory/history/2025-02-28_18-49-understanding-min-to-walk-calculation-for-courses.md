## Understanding "Min to Walk" Calculation for Courses (28/02/2025, 18:49:13)

_**User**_

On the courses page where we show available courses the course card currently features a line for "Min to Walk". 

How is the number that is show for each course calculated? Can you explain and show me the relevent files please?

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user wants to understand how the "Min to Walk" time is calculated for each golf course card on the courses page. They're asking for an explanation and to see the relevant files.

Looking at the provided `src/app/courses/page.tsx` file, I can see that there's a line on each course card that displays walking time:

```jsx
{/* Walking Time Estimate */}
<div className="flex items-start mb-3">
  <Clock className="w-4 h-4 text-gray-500 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />
  <p className="ml-1 text-gray-600 text-sm">
    ~{estimateWalkingTime(course.numberOfHoles, course.ratings?.walkability)} min to walk
  </p>
</div>
```

This is using a function called `estimateWalkingTime` that takes two parameters:
1. `course.numberOfHoles` - The number of holes in the golf course
2. `course.ratings?.walkability` - The walkability rating of the course

The function is being imported at the top of the file:
```javascript
import { estimateWalkingTime } from '@/lib/utils/walkabilityRating'
```

To fully explain how this calculation works, I need to find and examine the `estimateWalkingTime` function in the project. It should be located in the file `src/lib/utils/walkabilityRating.ts` (or .js).

I'll search for this file to understand the calculation logic.</think>I can see you're interested in understanding how the "Min to Walk" calculation works for each golf course on the directory page. Let me explain this and show you the relevant files.

Looking at the course card in the displayed page code, I can see that the walking time is calculated using the `estimateWalkingTime()` function:

```typescript
<p className="ml-1 text-gray-600 text-sm">
  ~{estimateWalkingTime(course.numberOfHoles, course.ratings?.walkability)} min to walk
</p>
```

This function is imported from a utility file:

```typescript
import { estimateWalkingTime } from '@/lib/utils/walkabilityRating'
```

Let me find the actual implementation of this function to show you exactly how it works.

Based on the code I found, I can now explain how the "Min to Walk" time is calculated for each golf course:

## How Walking Time is Calculated

The walking time is calculated using the `estimateWalkingTime` function found in `/src/lib/utils/walkabilityRating.ts`. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Function Definition:

```typescript
export function estimateWalkingTime(holes: number, walkabilityRating?: Partial<WalkabilityRating>): number {
  // Base time for an average course (in minutes)
  const baseTime = holes === 9 ? 110 : 220; // 9 holes: ~110 mins, 18 holes: ~220 mins
  
  // If we have detailed ratings, adjust the time
  if (walkabilityRating) {
    let modifier = 1.0;
    
    // Terrain affects walking time
    if (walkabilityRating.hilliness !== undefined) {
      // Lower terrain rating (hillier) = more time
      modifier += (5 - walkabilityRating.hilliness) * 0.05;
    }
    
    // Distance between holes affects walking time
    if (walkabilityRating.holeDistance !== undefined) {
      // Lower holeDistance rating (longer walks) = more time
      modifier += (5 - walkabilityRating.holeDistance) * 0.08;
    }
    
    return Math.round(baseTime * modifier);
  }
  
  return baseTime;
}
```

### Parameters:

1. `holes`: The number of holes in the golf course (typically 9 or 18)
2. `walkabilityRating`: An optional object with detailed ratings about the course walkability

### Calculation Logic:

1. **Base Time Calculation**:
   - For a 9-hole course: 110 minutes
   - For an 18-hole course: 220 minutes

2. **Adjustments Based on Walkability Factors**:
   If walkability ratings are available, the base time is adjusted using:

   - **Hilliness (Terrain)**: On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is very hilly and 5 is flat
     - Hillier courses (lower ratings) increase walking time
     - Each point away from perfectly flat (5) adds 5% to the time

   - **Distance Between Holes**: On a scale of 1-5, where 1 means long walks between holes and 5 means compact layout
     - Courses with longer distances between holes (lower ratings) increase walking time
     - Each point away from compact layout (5) adds 8% to the time

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The base time is multiplied by the modifier
   - The result is rounded to the nearest whole number

### Example:

For an 18-hole course with a hilliness rating of 3 (moderate) and a hole distance rating of 2 (spread out):

```
baseTime = 220 minutes (18 holes)
hilliness modifier = (5 - 3) * 0.05 = 0.10
holeDistance modifier = (5 - 2) * 0.08 = 0.24
total modifier = 1.0 + 0.10 + 0.24 = 1.34
walking time = 220 * 1.34 = 295 minutes (rounded)
```

The estimated time would be shown as "~295 min to walk" on the course card.

This calculation provides a realistic walking time estimate that accounts for the course's physical characteristics, making it helpful for walking golfers to plan their rounds.

OK, that's quite clever, but we don't need it. Remove that line from the course card. and also remove how it is calculated from the information you just showed me as we're never going to use it thanks

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user wants me to remove the walking time estimate line from the course card in the courses listing page. I need to:

1. Find the exact line in the course card component that displays the walking time
2. Edit the file to remove this line
3. Also remove the function that calculates the walking time from the walkabilityRating.ts file since they won't be using it anymore

Let me start by editing the course card in the courses page:</think>I'll remove the walking time estimate line from the course card and also remove the calculation function from the walkabilityRating utility file.

First, let me edit the course card in the courses page:

```diff
                        </p>
                      </div>
-                     
-                     {/* Walking Time Estimate */}
-                     <div className="flex items-start mb-3">
-                       <Clock className="w-4 h-4 text-gray-500 mt-1 flex-shrink-0" />
-                       <p className="ml-1 text-gray-600 text-sm">
-                         ~{estimateWalkingTime(course.numberOfHoles, course.ratings?.walkability)} min to walk
-                       </p>
-                     </div>
                      
                      {/* Walkability Rating */}
```

Now, let me check if the `estimateWalkingTime` import is still being used elsewhere in the file and remove it if not:

Now I'll remove the import from the course page:

---

_****_

```diff
  import useFirebase from '@/lib/hooks/useFirebase'
  import { query, collection, where, orderBy, limit, startAfter, getDocs, QueryDocumentSnapshot, DocumentData } from 'firebase/firestore'
- import { estimateWalkingTime } from '@/lib/utils/walkabilityRating'
  
  // Constants
```

---

_****_





Since we're not using the Clock icon anymore, let's also remove it from the imports:

---

_****_

```diff
  import { IMAGES } from '@/lib/constants/images'
  import { CompactStarRating } from '@/components/StarRating'
- import { MapPin, Clock, Filter } from 'lucide-react'
+ import { MapPin, Filter } from 'lucide-react'
  import useFirebase from '@/lib/hooks/useFirebase'
  import { query, collection, where, orderBy, limit, startAfter, getDocs, QueryDocumentSnapshot, DocumentData } from 'firebase/firestore'
```

---

_****_





Now, let's remove the `estimateWalkingTime` function from the walkabilityRating.ts file since it won't be used:

---

_****_

```diff
    return 'hilly';
  }
- 
- /**
-  * Calculate the walking time based on the course properties
-  * This is a rough estimate - can be refined with more data
-  */
- export function estimateWalkingTime(holes: number, walkabilityRating?: Partial<WalkabilityRating>): number {
-   // Base time for an average course (in minutes)
-   const baseTime = holes === 9 ? 110 : 220; // 9 holes: ~110 mins, 18 holes: ~220 mins
-   
-   // If we have detailed ratings, adjust the time
-   if (walkabilityRating) {
-     let modifier = 1.0;
-     
-     // Terrain affects walking time
-     if (walkabilityRating.hilliness !== undefined) {
-       // Lower terrain rating (hillier) = more time
-       modifier += (5 - walkabilityRating.hilliness) * 0.05;
-     }
-     
-     // Distance between holes affects walking time
-     if (walkabilityRating.holeDistance !== undefined) {
-       // Lower holeDistance rating (longer walks) = more time
-       modifier += (5 - walkabilityRating.holeDistance) * 0.08;
-     }
-     
-     return Math.round(baseTime * modifier);
-   }
-   
-   return baseTime;
- }
  
  /**
```

I've successfully made the requested changes:

1. Removed the walking time estimate line from the course card in `src/app/courses/page.tsx`:
   - Deleted the "Walking Time Estimate" section that displayed "~X min to walk"
   - Removed the `estimateWalkingTime` import
   - Removed the unused `Clock` icon import

2. Removed the `estimateWalkingTime` function from `src/lib/utils/walkabilityRating.ts`:
   - Completely removed the function and its documentation comments

The course cards will now be simpler, showing only the course name, location, and walkability rating. The walking time estimate has been completely removed from the application as requested.
